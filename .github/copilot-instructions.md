This is a Node.js TypeScript backend project for chunking text for LLM vectorization. Prioritize efficient, configurable chunking logic and robust API design.

## Demo

For our demo at `index.html`, we use the following stack:

- The entire demo should fit entirely in `index.html`. (No other JS or CSS files.)
- ESM modules only and import maps for bare dependencies.
- External dependencies should come from https://esm.sh/. Do not add any dependencies to `package.json`.
- Use React and [htm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htm) for the app and UI.
- Use https://pure-css.github.io/ for styling.
- Use https://phosphoricons.com/ for icons.
